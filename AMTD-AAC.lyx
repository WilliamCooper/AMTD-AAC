\begin_layout Abstract
Many systems for measuring wind on research aircraft rely on inertial navigation
 systems for the measurement of pitch, roll, and heading, and uncertainties
 in those measurements are often the dominant source of uncertainty in measureme
nts of wind.
 Simple algorithms that can improve those measurements in data sets already
 collected or in future measurement campaigns are developed here.
 It is demonstrated that with those algorithms uncertainties in these attitude
 angles can be reduced to 0.01
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 or less and that this leads to a significant reduction in uncertainty associate
d with the measurements of wind.
 The use of Global Positioning System receivers to improve these measurements
 has a long history and the general basis for the approach developed here
 is not new, but the specific implementation is particularly suited to improving
 measurement capabilities for atmospheric research.
 Code for implementing these algorithms, provided as supplemental material,
 is developed for the data sets archived and collected by the Research Aviation
 Facility of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, but it could
 be applied to other data sources also.

\begin_layout Standard
Inertial navigation systems (INSs) used, e.g., on research aircraft provide
 measurements of the pitch, roll, and heading of the aircraft, here called
 the attitude angles of the aircraft.
 Errors in these angles can arise from many sources, but it appears that
 dominant sources are errors in initial alignment and errors that result
 from in-flight drift, often associated with horizontal accelerations.
 These errors often are the dominant errors in measurements of wind from
 research aircraft.
 The examples here are drawn from data collected using the NSF/NCAR Gulfstream
 V research aircraft, and at typical flight speeds of that aircraft an uncertain
ty in pitch of 0.05
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

, the specification for the INS on that aircraft, leads to an uncertainty
 in vertical wind of about 0.2
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

m/s.
 A separate analysis of uncertainty for that measurement (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Cooper2016ncartn"

\end_inset

) shows that uncertainty in pitch is the dominant source of uncertainty
 in measured vertical wind.
 The uncertainty in heading is still larger and leads to a proportionately
 larger uncertainty in the lateral component of the horizontal wind.
 Therefore, correcting for these errors can lead to significant improvement
 in the measurements of wind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The standard method for correcting such errors is via a Kalman filter, where
 the error sources are represented by an error model and the corrected set
 of measurements is obtained by detecting and providing feedback for errors
 determined by comparing the INS measurements to some reference such as
 measurements from a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver.
 This approach is discussed in many books and articles, including for example
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "noureldin2013fundamentals"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "groves2013PrinciplesGNSS"

\end_inset

, and additional references cited therein.
 The Kalman filter requires extensive information regarding the characteristics
 of the measuring system and can be complex.
 While this approach provides good results, it is often difficult to know
 what corrections are made, how good they are, and how they relate to the
 flight conditions.
 Incorporation of a good Kalman filter requires either a substantial development
 project or an expensive addition to the INS itself.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The intent of this note is to provide alternative corrections for all three
 attitude angles on the basis of relatively simple comparisons between measureme
nts available from the combination of an INS and a GPS receiver.
 These corrections can be applied to archived data and so can lead to improvemen
ts in datasets collected in past as well as future projects.
 In the case of pitch and roll, the solution relies on observation of the
 derivatives in the errors in ground-speed components and position, which
 arise primarily from errors in those angles.
 For heading, the accelerations measured by the INS are compared to those
 determined by differentiating the GPS-provided ground-speed components.
 This difference is dependent on the error in heading because the accelerations
 are measured in the body frame of the aircraft (here called
\emph on
 
\emph default
the 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

-frame), and translation to an Earth-reference frame (or 
\emph on
l
\emph default
-frame) involves the heading.
 An error in heading results in a difference between the two sets of measured
 accelerations, and that difference can be used to estimate the error in
 heading.
 As developed here, all three corrections are applied to measurements after
 acquisition, not during recording, to be able to use algorithms that smooth
 measurements over centered intervals.
 This also makes it possible to correct archived data as long as the full
 set of INS measurements including accelerations and measurements of ground-spee
d by both an INS and a GPS receiver are available.

A technical note discussing the uncertainty in measurements of wind for
 this research aircraft (

 the wind-sensing system.
 The appendix to this paper summarizes key results from that technical note.

\begin_layout Standard
An inertial system aligns during initialization to detect the local vertical
 direction and then calculates the new vertical direction as the aircraft
 moves (changing the local vertical direction) and accelerates (which can
 cause gyros to precess).
 Any mis-alignment present at initialization persists but also will oscillate
 and will cause errors in roll and pitch to mix as the aircraft changes
 flight direction.
 For the inertial system used on the NSF/NCAR GV, the standard uncertainty
 associated with this measurement is 0.05
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 in both roll and pitch for flight duration of a few hours, and the error
 often increases during the flight as heading errors and accelerometer biases
 affect the results.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The work of Schuler (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Schuler1923"

\end_inset

) showed that coupling among some of these error sources leads to limits
 on the growth of errors and to simultaneous oscillations in some of the
 measurement errors.
 In particular, an error in pitch leads to an error in horizontal acceleration
 because gravity is resolved to have a horizontal component, and integration
 of that error in horizontal acceleration leads to a position error that
 grows so as to compensate for the false component of acceleration arising
 from the original error in pitch.
 However, when the error in pitch is reduced to zero, errors in position
 and velocity have been accumulated and those lead to growth of the error
 in pitch in the direction opposite to the original error.
 The result is a Schuler oscillation having a period of 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{Sch}=(R_{e}/g)^{0.5}/(2\pi)\approx5064\thinspace s$
\end_inset

 or 84.4
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

min, where 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{e}$
\end_inset

 is the radius of the Earth and 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 the acceleration of gravity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The existence of this coupling allows estimation of the pitch error if the
 error in horizontal acceleration is known.
 That is the case if, in addition to the INS, there is a GPS receiver that
 can provide high-quality measurements of Earth-relative velocity.
 Modern GPS receivers, especially if they incorporate differential-GPS correctio
ns or ionispheric corrections, produce velocity measurements that have remarkabl
y low uncertainty, often a few cm/s, so these can be considered a standard
 against which to compare the corresponding IRS-measured velocities.
 The difference between ground-speed components from the two systems thus
 determines the error in INS-measured velocity and, after differentiation,
 the error in horizontal acceleration.

The differentiated errors in the components of the aircraft ground-speed
 and the errors in position thus can provide estimates for corrections to
 be applied to the measurements of pitch and roll.
 Because this correction relies on the observable effects of the errors
 on velocity, it is not sensitive to the source of the error, whether it
 arises from misalignment before flight, bias errors in the INS gyros, or
 other sources except for these exceptions: (i) an error in measured acceleratio
n from the accelerometers that contributes to the velocity errors in a way
 not dependent on the pitch or roll errors; and (ii) a minor dependence
 on error in heading that arises when the pitch and roll errors in the Earth-rel
ative 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

-frame are transformed to the reference frame of the aircraft.
 The latter is negligible for normal heading errors, but the former can
 cause increasing amplitude or drift of the velocity errors.
 Figures to be shown below of the observed errors in ground-speed components
 suggest relatively small changes in the amplitude of the Schuler oscillation
 during most flights, as would be expected if the accelerometer errors make
 only small contributions to the velocity errors.

The research flights have frequent changes in heading, with associated mixing
 of the roll and pitch errors but also accelerations that affect those errors
 and introduce new errors from heading errors.
 The corrections to pitch therefore appear much less systematic than was
 the case for the ferry flight, and in some cases the corrections are considerab
ly larger.
 An example, DEEPWAVE research flight 1 (June 6 2014), is presented here.

Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The magnitude of the correction in the example shown is significant in compariso
n to the total uncertainty in measurements of vertical wind (discussed further
 in the Appendix), so correction for this error should lead to a significant
 reduction in the uncertainty associated with the measured vertical wind.
 There can be various sources for the error in pitch, including initial
 alignment, bias or other errors from the IRS sensors, possible effects
 of horizontal accelerations or turbulence on platform alignment, and others.
 However, the equations (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:final-answer"

\end_inset

) used to detect this error do not depend on the source of the error; any
 error in pitch will introduce an error in horizontal acceleration, and
 that error can be detected by comparison to corresponding measurements
 from the GPS receiver provided that the measurements from the GPS unit
 are accurate and the INS accelerometers themselves introduce little error.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Modern GPS receivers, often incorporating differential-GPS corrections and
 ionospheric corrections, are capable of measuring horizontal motions with
 uncertainties as small as 3

 From (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:full-delta-pitch"

\end_inset

), this suggests an uncertainty in the pitch correction of about 0.002 or
 0.1
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 for measurements with this separation.
 It appears from plots like those shown above that the pitch correction
 varies only slowly with time, so this estimate can be improved significantly
 by using longer averaging times.
 For times of 5
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

min, for example, the uncertainty in acceleration can be less than 0.0001
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

s
\begin_inset Formula $^{-1}$
\end_inset

 and the corresponding uncertainty in the pitch correction is less than
 0.002
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The uncertainty introduced by errors in measured horizontal acceleration
 is more difficult to estimate.
 The errors they introduce in ground-speed components contribute to errors
 in pitch and roll through the strong coupling between ground-speed-component
 errors and attitude-angle errors, so the algorithm proposed here will correct
 for a portion of the past history of contributions via accelerometer errors
 but not the immediate contribution at the observation time.
 Because normal measurements of lateral accelerations are quite small and
 appear unbiased away from turns, it is likely that these errors arise primarily
 during turns and can be diagnosed away from turns.
 One estimate of the magnitude of this contribution can be based on the
 growth of the magnitude of the Schuler oscillation in ground-speed errors,
 which in normal cases is limited to about 0.5
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}

\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

s
\begin_inset Formula $^{-2}$
\end_inset

.
 As argued in the preceding paragraph, this magnitude of uncertainty in
 acceleration would lead to uncertainty in pitch correction of less than
 0.002
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this level, the uncertainty in pitch arising from the measurements of
 horizontal acceleration from either the INS or GPS receiver does not make
 a significant contribution to the uncertainty in measurements of vertical
 wind because other sources dominate, as discussed in the Appendix.
 For straight flight paths, the correction procedure thus can be considered
 to remove the error in pitch.
 In turns, however, the relative timing of the measurements can introduce
 biases that cause errors extending not only during but also for a short
 period before and after the turns, with duration depending on the averaging
 period used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For research applications, the roll correction is seldom of much consequence,
 but the pitch correction can either produce significant improvement in
 the calculated vertical wind or, when small, can reduce the uncertainty
 below that based solely on specifications for the measurement from the
 IRS.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "eq:final-answer"

\end_inset

) provides a correction applicable to each measurement, some smoothing is
 desirable not only to decrease the uncertainty in the correction but also
 to avoid introducing high-frequency noise into signals that might distort
 the variance spectrum or affect other uses where noise is undesirable.
 A specific choice was made for the examples shown, but other choices might
 perform better and may benefit from tailoring to the flight patterns.
 The velocity errors usually vary smoothly and approximately sinusoidally,
 as shown in Figs.

 the derivatives required in (

) and (

-frame where these errors are measured they are usually quite regular over
 several oscillations so this provides a compromise between good smoothing
 and response to changes in the amplitude and phase of the oscillations.
 This usually produces smooth corrections except near turns, where some
 more abrupt changes occur.
 Most research measurements of wind are made during straight flight legs,
 so these fluctuations near turns are not a serious impediment in the normal
 case.
 They appear to arise from timing differences among the different measurements
 being used.
 For example, if the measurement of heading lags behind the derivatives,
 the rotation of 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

-frame errors to the 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

-frame will lead to different errors in right vs.

The basis for the correction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A procedure related to that used for pitch is developed here for estimating
 the error in heading.
 The basis for the correction is that an error in heading results in an
 error in how the measured body-relative components of the acceleration
 are transformed to the ENU or 
\emph on
l
\emph default
-frame (in the terminology of the previous discussion of the correction
 for pitch).
 These errors can be detected by comparing the actual acceleration of the
 aircraft (determined from derivatives of the GPS-measured ground-speed
 components, as in the preceding section) to the measurements of acceleration
 after transformation to the 
\emph on
l
\emph default
-frame.

Some additional considerations arising from rotation of the earth and rotation
 of the 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

-frame in an inertial frame are discussed later; cf.

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

).
\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The accelerations measured by a strap-down inertial system like the Honeywell
 systems on the NCAR/NSF GV are the accelerations in the reference frame
 of the aircraft, here called the 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

-frame.
 To transform these to the 
\emph on
l
\emph default
-frame, the transformation by conventional definition of the attitude angles
 involves a rotation about the roll axis to level the wings, a rotation
 about the pitch axis to level the longitudinal axis of the aircraft, and
 a rotation about the vertical axis as required to point the aircraft to
 the north.
 However, if there is an error in the heading (
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\psi$
\end_inset

) the last rotation will give final components 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{x,y,z}^{(l)}$
\end_inset

 that have respective errors of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta a_{x}^{(l)}=a_{x}^{(l)}(1-\cos\delta\psi)-a_{y}^{(l)}\sin\delta\psi$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta a_{y}^{(l)}=a_{y}^{(l)}(1-\cos\delta\psi)+a_{x}^{(l)}\sin\delta\psi$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta a_{z}^{(l)}=0$
\end_inset

 or, for small angles,
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\left[\begin{array}{c}
\delta a_{x}^{(l)}\\
\delta a_{y}^{(l)}\\
\delta a_{z}^{(l)}
\end{array}\right] & =\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & -\delta\psi & 0\\
\delta\psi & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
a_{x}^{(l)}\\
a_{y}^{(l)}\\
a_{z}^{(l)}
\end{array}\right]\label{eq:heading-error-equation}\\
\delta a_{x}^{(l)} & =-a_{y}^{(l)}\delta\psi\label{eq:ax-error}\\
\delta a_{y}^{(l)} & =a_{x}^{(l)}\delta\psi\label{eq:ay-error}\\
\delta\psi & =\frac{a_{x}^{(l)}\delta a_{y}^{(l)}-a_{y}^{(l)}\delta a_{x}^{(l)}}{(a_{x}^{(l)})^{2}+(a_{y}^{(l)})^{2}}\label{eq:estimator-equation}
\end{align}

\end_inset

The last equation is obtained

If the error measure to be minimized is 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}=(\delta a_{x}+a_{y}\delta\psi)^{2}+(\delta a_{y}-a_{x}\delta\psi)^{2}$

\begin_inset Formula $\chi^{2}$
\end_inset

 with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\psi$

) and the measured error given by 
\begin_inset Formula $(a_{i}^{*}-a_{i}^{(l)})$
\end_inset

.
 This then gives an estimate of the rotation 
\begin_inset Formula $-\delta\psi$
\end_inset

 that gives the best match between the measured accelerations and those
 determined from the derivatives of the GPS-provided ground-speed components.
 The resulting value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\psi$
\end_inset

 from (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:estimator-equation"

) is then an estimate of the error in heading.

\begin_layout Standard
To use (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:estimator-equation"

\end_inset

), the acceleration vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a^{*}}$
\end_inset

 must be determined by differentiation of the GPS-measured velocity components.
 As in the pitch-correction algorithm, the choice made here is to estimate
 the derivatives using Savitzky-Golay polynomials, but now with a 31
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

s span to avoid excessive distortion in 3-min turns.
 However, this choice affects the uncertainty of the estimate, as follows.
 It was previously estimated that the uncertainty in a measurement of accelerati
on from GPS is at least 0.01
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

s
\begin_inset Formula $^{-1}$
\end_inset

/
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 is the time over which the average is calculated.
 For 31-s polynomial fits, the effective averaging time is about 20
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

s, leading to a minimum uncertainty of about 0.0005

 Equation
\begin_inset space ~

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

) indicates that, for an uncertainty in the heading correction of 0.1
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$

 or about 0.002

 only provides a valid correction if there are regular turns during the
 flight.

 when the horizontal acceleration exceeds 1

 to avoid excessive noise and uncertainty.
 It is significant, though, that for a flight that transits in a straight
 line from start to finish, attempts to use these estimates are unlikely
 to be useful.
 Fortunately, in most research flights there are many turns, e.g., as the
 aircraft flies back and forth over a mountain range or flies fixed raster
 patterns for mapping.
 Each turn can provide significant horizontal accelerations that give estimates
 of the heading error, but these estimates are only sporadic and must be
 linked by an extrapolation procedure to obtain valid corrections spanning
 periods without significant acceleration.
 The heading correction therefore has a higher uncertainty than the pitch
 correction and, unlike the pitch correction, depends on significant horizontal
 accelerations for its operation.
 In addition, the heading error is not coupled to other errors in ways that
 limit its growth, so implementing some correction procedure is important
 not only to provide corrections but also to determine the estimated magnitude
 of the uncorrected error.

Measurements of body accelerations are provided by most inertial systems

 The acceleration components therefore have sinusoidal variations, and as

 This checks the transformations and shows sufficient agreement without
 substantial noise, a requirement if the small difference is to be used

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
A proposed correction algorithm for heading
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The requirements for this algorithm are as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The flight pattern must include maneuvers that provide horizontal accelerations,
 usually turns of at least 30
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

s duration 
\emph on
in each direction.

\emph default
 The reason is that it is difficult to correct for timing errors in the
 measurements of heading relative to the measured ground-speed components
 from a GPS receiver, and even a delay of 50
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

ms will, for a turn rate corresponding to a three-minute turn through 360
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

, lead to a 0.05
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 false indication of a heading error.
 However, the error reverses sign with the direction of the turn, so averaging
 the results from left turns and from right turns will correct for this
 false indication of a heading error.
 Course-reversal maneuvers like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

90-270
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 turns (90
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 one direction followed by 270
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 the other direction) provide good data for this algorithm, as do 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

60-300-60
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 teardrop turns that are a faster means of returning to the starting point.
 If wind measurements are critical to the research, it may be useful to
 include patterns like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

S
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 turns periodically, with 30
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

s turns in opposite directions, to provide the needed accelerations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To the extent possible, sampled time series should be corrected for sampling
 delays.
 The most important such correction is the timing of the heading measurement
 from the INS relative to the ground-speed measurements from the GPS.
 In the examples shown in this note, the differences between different turn
 directions were minimized by shifting the heading forward in time by 140
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

ms.
 The averaging provided by the first item above helps reduce errors from
 timing, but it is still preferable to keep those errors small.
 Full-circle patterns flown in each turn direction provide a sensitive test
 of timing errors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many research flights and research data sets meet these requirements, and
 where wind measurement is important they can be incorporated into flight
 plans for future projects.
 The algorithm implemented here, for which specific R code is available,
 follows these steps:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\emph on
Shift the timing of the heading measurement as needed to match the GPS-receiver
 measurements of ground velocity.
 
\emph default
The result of this procedure is very sensitive to differences in timing
 of measurements from the IRS and GPS, because in turns any lag appears
 as an offset in the accelerations that mimics a heading error.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\emph on
Optionally, apply pitch and roll corrections using the algorithm developed
 in Sect.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Correcting-the-pitch"

\end_inset

.
 
\emph default
The measurements of pitch and, to a lesser extent, roll affect the transformatio
n of the accelerations from the 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

-frame to the 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

-frame, but only have a very small effect, so omission of this step normally
 makes no detectable difference in the final heading correction..
 
\begin_inset Note Note
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Although the correction developed here depends only weakly on the correction
 to pitch and roll, inclusion of this step may protect against or at least
 identify anomalously large errors in pitch.
 Reciprocally, the pitch correction depends on the measured heading, but
 the effect of heading errors are insignificant.
 Omission of this step normally makes no detectable difference.

\begin_layout Standard
Flight 16 from the DEEPWAVE project was a more typical research flight,
 in which repeated passes were flown over the mountainous terrain of New
 Zealand.
 Legs of typically about 45 min duration started and ended with turns that
 usually reversed course and so provided good accelerations for correcting
 the measurement of heading.

 The standard deviation represents a low uncertainty that, translated to

, and this is typical of most research flights examined including all but
 two of the 26 flights from the DEEPWAVE project.
 This is evidence that the measurement of pitch introduces little uncertainty
 into the measured vertical wind.
 Without this result, the instrument specification (0.05
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$

) would be the estimated uncertainty in pitch, so the uncertainty in vertical
 wind is reduced significantly by this algorithm even if the correction
 is not applied.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Reverse-heading legs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the pitch correction reduces the error in pitch, wind measurements made
 before and after level course reversal would be expected to match better
 after correction because, if there is a pitch error, its contribution to
 the vertical wind would reverse sign between the two legs.
 Table
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Flight-segments"

\end_inset

 lists four instances from the DEEPWAVE project where the flight track reversed
 course and remained at the same altitude.
 Some other candidates were excluded because conditions were too variable
 along the legs to produce a small-uncertainty estimate of the vertical
 wind, or because (as was the normal case in these research flights) the
 flight level changed.
 For these selected cases, the sample standard deviation for the vertical
 wind was typically about 0.3

 In each of the five cases, flight periods of about 5 min (sometimes adjusted
 in cases of strong wind to give similar-spatial-length segments flown upwind
 and downwind) are listed before and after the turn, but excluding the turn,
 to represent approximately overlapping flight segments where it would be
 expected that the vertical wind would be the same.

 This level of uncertainty would arise from an uncertainty in pitch of less

 mean difference in vertical wind may arise mostly from natural variability.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Estimated uncertainty in the corrected pitch
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the uncertainty in pitch is less than about 0.01
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

, it may be unnecessary to refine that estimate because at that level other
 effects dominate the uncertainty in vertical wind.
 However, some additional estimates can be obtained by considering the terms
 affecting the estimates (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:full-delta-pitch"

\end_inset

) and (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:delta-phi"

\end_inset

), dependent on how well the derivative of the errors in ground-speed components
 can be determined and how well this derivative can be transformed via (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:final-answer"

\end_inset

) to the reference frame of the aircraft.
 Estimates based on this approach lead to exceptionally small uncertainty
 in the pitch correction, smaller than 0.0001
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

, so uncertainties arising from other sources are likely dominant.
 Most sources of error, however, are addressed by the correction algorithm.
 The basic measurements from the INS are the body accelerations and body
 rotations.
 An error in the integration of the body rotations leads to an error in
 pitch that produces a false component of horizontal acceleration, so this
 will appear as an erroneous contribution to the ground-speed components
 and will be detected by the proposed algorithm.
 If the measured accelerations are in error, this leads to a position error
 and so to a pitch error, but again the erroneous accelerations are detected
 by comparison to GPS measurements and lead to a correction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An error not addressed by the algorithm, however, is that arising from timing
 errors between INS and GPS.
 Especially in turns, a timing error will bias the measured errors in ground-spe
ed components and so bias the result.
 Therefore, if the samples are not synchronous they must be shifted to match.
 This can be done by minimizing the perturbations that occur in turns.
 However, even small timing differences can have serious effects on the
 correction algorithm.

\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$

 This error changes direction at the turn rate so it leads to a false accelerati

\end_inset

) then leads to an error in the pitch correction of about 0.015
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

.
 While this appears to be the dominant source of uncertainty in the pitch
 correction, it only occurs in turns and should not affect measurements
 during straight flight segments.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It appears appropriate to use a conservative estimate of 
\begin_inset Formula $\ll0.01{}^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 as the uncertainty to be applied to pitch.
 At this level, for the NSF/NCAR GV, the Appendix illustrates that the uncertain
ty in vertical wind is determined primarily by uncertainty in the measurement
 of angle of attack, and the pitch uncertainty is of little significance.

7.1.
 These flight patterns provide an alternate and independent way of estimating
 the heading error, because if the wind remains steady over the course of
 the circle then a positive heading error will lead to an erroneous eastward
 component of the wind while flying northward and a similar negative component
 when flying southward.
 A similar effect is present in the measured northward component of the
 wind.
 It is therefore possible to estimate the heading error by fitting a sinusoidal
 variation to the wind speed or to components of the wind speed.
 The result of that analysis was an indicated heading error of 
\begin_inset Formula $-$
\end_inset

0.09
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

, consistent with the error found here, although with a significantly larger
 uncertainty of 0.09
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 arising from variations among the three circle maneuvers analyzed.
 This variation likely arose from unsteady wind conditions around the circles.

\begin_layout Standard
An algorithm for correcting measurements of all three attitude angles (roll,
 pitch, and heading) apparently leads to significant improvement in conventional
 measurements from a high-quality inertial navigation system (INS) that
 does not use Kalman-filter updates to improve the measurements.
 The corrections are based on fits to centered portions of the flight and
 so can have advantages over recursive single-directional Kalman filters,
 and they do not require detailed knowledge of the error characteristics
 of the INS.
 In the case of pitch and roll, the procedure used neglects possible acceleromet
er biases by assuming that the velocity errors (determined by comparison
 to GPS-derived values) and attitude-angle errors are coupled via the Schuler
 oscillation.
 In the case of heading, the measured accelerations are transformed to an
 Earth-reference frame and compared to GPS measurements of acceleration,
 so this also neglects possible biases in the accelerometers.
 It is also necessary that the measurements from the INS and the GPS receiver
 be coincident in time or be shifted to coincide, preferably to a tolerance
 of around 20 ms.
 With these assumptions, corrections to pitch and roll result in residual
 uncertainties of less than 0.01
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

, and similar corrections to heading have uncertainty of about 0.01
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 if there are periodic turns (at about 45-min intervals) that give the accelerat
ions required for this estimate.

The total pressure (from the sum of the ambient pressure measurement and
 the dynamic pressure measurement) on the C-130 as a function of the magnitude
 of the side-slip angle during yaw manoeuvres in which sideslip angles were
 forced by rudder action while the aircraft continued on approximately a
 straight-and-level course.
 The mean total pressure of 760.6
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

hPa has been subtracted from the measurements.
 Error bars are standard deviations in the measurements for the total-pressure
 axis and are the range of the bin used in sideslip.
 Corrections for deviations from a level course and for small variations
 in airspeed have been applied, as discussed in the text.
